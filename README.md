# Smart Library - Final Year Graduation Project

## 📚 Project Overview

**Smart Library** is an IoT-based library automation system designed to streamline the **borrowing and returning of books** using **RFID smart cards**. The system integrates **hardware components** and a **web application** to provide an efficient, secure, and user-friendly experience for both students and library staff.

The project is built using:
- **RFID technology** for identifying books and users
- **NodeMCU (ESP8266)** for IoT communication
- **C++ (Arduino)** to control hardware logic
- **CodeIgniter 4 (CI4)** PHP framework for the backend
- **MySQL** database for storing user and book data
- **JavaScript & jQuery** for frontend interactivity

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Smart Borrowing & Returning**  
  Users can borrow and return books using RFID smart cards linked to their accounts.

- **Automated Penalty System**  
  Applies fines for **late returns**, **lost books**, or **damaged items**.

- **Real-Time Updates**  
  The system syncs real-time data between the IoT device and web portal.

- **Admin Dashboard**  
  Library staff can manage books, users, and track borrowing history.
